# Programming-Recursion
Assignment consists of implementing recursive functions in order to find and print the ancestors or descendents of a person object in a family tree, composed using a Family class. 

# What I Implemented
1. Created Person class which is used to create unique instances of individuals in a family tree (uses static variable next_id)
2. Family class, holds arraylist of type Person to keep track of members in a family
3. printParents() uses recursion to print ancestors of Person instance in a family tree
4. printChildren() uses recursion to print descendents of Person instance in family tree


# Final Output

Figure of Family Tree
